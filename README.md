# Daigaku Gurashi Mods
a repo for mods I've made for Daigaku Gurashi v0.9.0

# How to install this (WARNING: read all the sentence)
you need to have Daigaku Gurashi version 0.9.0
- drag the repo's `Assembly-CSharp.dll` into `Daigaku Gurashi_Data > Managed`, and replace it (might want to back up the old version).
- put the `ModLoader.dll`, and the `mods` folder in the game folder itself.


# Examples coming soon..
